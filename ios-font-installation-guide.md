## iOS Font Installation Guide

Installing fonts on iOS through configuration profiles is a standardized and powerful method, particularly suitable for enterprise/school bulk deployment or advanced users who want to add fonts at the system level.

This method creates a configuration file with a `.mobileconfig` extension. Below I'll provide a detailed overview of the entire implementation process.

### Key Advantages

Using configuration profiles to install fonts offers several key advantages:

* **System-level Integration**: Fonts are installed at the system level, and many apps that support custom fonts (such as Pages, Keynote, Word, Procreate, etc.) can directly access them.
* **Bulk Deployment**: For enterprises or educational institutions, a font profile can be pushed to hundreds or thousands of devices through MDM (Mobile Device Management) systems.
* **Stable and Reliable**: Unlike some font apps, this method doesn't depend on third-party applications running in the background. Once installed, it takes effect permanently (unless you remove the profile).
* **Security**: Configuration profiles can be signed to ensure their source is reliable and hasn't been tampered with.

### Method 1: Using Apple Configurator (Recommended, Simplest)

This is Apple's officially recommended and most intuitive method. You only need a Mac computer.

#### Step 1: Preparation

1.  **A Mac computer**.
2.  Download and install **Apple Configurator** from the Mac App Store (this is Apple's official free tool).
3.  Prepare the font files you want to install, supporting **TrueType (.ttf)** or **OpenType (.otf)** formats.

#### Step 2: Create Font Configuration Profile

1.  Open Apple Configurator.

2.  In the menu bar, select **"File" > "New Profile"**.

3.  **Configure "General" Payload**:

    *   This is a required section for every configuration profile.
    *   **Name**: Give the profile an easily recognizable name, such as "My Custom Font Pack". This name will be displayed in the iPhone's settings.
    *   **Identifier**: Enter a unique identifier, typically using reverse domain name format, such as `com.yourname.fonts.custom`. This is used by the system to distinguish between different profiles.
    *   Other fields can be filled out as needed. For personal use, the above two items are essential.

4.  **Add "Fonts" Payload**:

    *   In the payload list on the left, scroll down and click **"Fonts"**.
    *   Click the **"Configure"** button on the right.
    *   You can directly drag and drop your `.ttf` or `.otf` font files into the font area, or click "Add Font" to select files. You can add multiple fonts at once.

#### Step 3: Save and Export Configuration Profile

1.  After configuration is complete, select **"File" > "Save"** in the menu bar.
2.  Name the file, for example `MyFonts.mobileconfig`, and save it to your Mac.
3.  **(Optional) Sign the profile**: Before saving, there's a "Sign Profile" option in the upper left corner. For personal use, you can save with "Don't Sign". Signing can increase security, prevent file tampering, and change the installation warning from "Unsigned" to "Verified".

#### Step 4: Install on iOS/iPadOS Device

Transfer the generated `.mobileconfig` file to your iPhone or iPad. There are several convenient methods:

*   **AirDrop**: The simplest method. Right-click the file on your Mac, select "Share" > "AirDrop", then send it to your iPhone/iPad.
*   **Email or Messages**: Send the file as an attachment to yourself.
*   **Cloud Services**: Upload to iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or Dropbox, then open it in the "Files" app on your device.

When you open this file on your iOS device, the system will guide you through the installation:

1.  The system will prompt **"Profile Downloaded"**.
2.  Open the **"Settings"** app. You'll see **"Profile Downloaded"** at the top.
3.  Tap it, then tap **"Install"** in the upper right corner.
4.  Enter your device unlock password.
5.  The system will display a warning (if the profile is unsigned, it will show "Unsigned Profile"). Tap **"Install"** again.
6.  Installation complete!

#### Step 5: Verify and Manage Fonts

*   To view installed fonts, go to **"Settings" > "General" > "Fonts"**. You'll see all fonts installed through profiles here.
*   To uninstall these fonts, simply remove the corresponding profile. Go to **"Settings" > "General" > "VPN & Device Management"**, find your installed font profile, and tap **"Remove Profile"**.

### Method 2: Manually Create XML File (Advanced)

If you don't have a Mac, or want to understand the underlying principles, you can manually create a `.mobileconfig` file. It's essentially an XML file.

Here's a basic template:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>PayloadContent</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>PayloadContent</key>
            <data>BASE64_ENCODED_FONT_DATA_HERE</data>
            <key>PayloadIdentifier</key>
            <string>com.yourname.fonts.custom.fontpayload</string> <key>PayloadType</key>
            <string>com.apple.font</string>
            <key>PayloadUUID</key>
            <string>UNIQUE_UUID_1</string> <key>PayloadVersion</key>
            <integer>1</integer>
            <key>Name</key>
            <string>Your Font Name.ttf</string> </dict>
        </array>
    <key>PayloadDisplayName</key>
    <string>My Custom Font Pack</string> <key>PayloadIdentifier</key>
    <string>com.yourname.fonts.custom</string> <key>PayloadType</key>
    <string>Configuration</string>
    <key>PayloadUUID</key>
    <string>UNIQUE_UUID_0</string> <key>PayloadVersion</key>
    <integer>1</integer>
</dict>
</plist>
```

**Key Steps**:

1.  **Base64 Encoding**: You need to convert your `.ttf` or `.otf` font files into Base64 encoded strings, then paste them between the `<data>` and `</data>` tags. You can use online tools or command line tools (like `base64 -i myfont.ttf -o myfont.txt`) to accomplish this.
2.  **Generate UUID**: `PayloadUUID` must be unique. You can use online UUID generators to create values for `UNIQUE_UUID_0` and `UNIQUE_UUID_1` (if you have multiple fonts, each font payload needs a separate UUID).
3.  **Fill in Identifiers**: Ensure `PayloadIdentifier` is unique.
4.  **Save File**: Save the edited text content as a file, ensuring its extension is `.mobileconfig`.

Afterward, transfer this file to an iOS device for installation, following the same steps as Method 1.

**In summary, for most users, using Apple Configurator is the fastest and least error-prone method.**
